Oakland-based artist Shogun Shido is an innovative creator who hails from New Orleans and uses art to explore the depths of introspection and observation. Shido’s subconscious stream line work is immediately recognizable, and can be seen around the Bay Area in various mediums ranging from canvas to murals, sculptures, clothing, and more.
This collaboration features Shido’s hand-painted X50 XPAC, which started out as one continuous roll of fabric before being laser cut into panels for each product.

We wanted one pack that could do it all, whether as an everyday carry or a weekender. Durable, lightweight and comfortable, the Mountain Pack is just as at home on a fishing trip as it is on a work trip. For this special limited run collaboration, we added a water-resistant truck tarp base that keeps gear inside clean and dry no matter where you happen to set the bag down. Large side pockets fit a 32 oz. Nalgene (or a fly rod) and the durable daisy chain webbing is perfect for securing extra gear or attaching a extra fly gear.
All of our Topo Designs x Howler Brothers Mountain Packs are handmade here in Colorado.
